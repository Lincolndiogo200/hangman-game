Key Features:

Random Word Selection: A secret word is randomly chosen from a predefined set for each new round.
Revealing Guessed Letters: As the user guesses the letters correctly, they are revealed in the word.

Responsive Design: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on mobile and desktop devices.
Technologies Used:

React with TypeScript: Used for building the interface and managing the game state.
CSS Modules: For modular styling and avoiding scope conflicts, ensuring a clean and organized design.

Game Flow:

The user starts the game with a randomly chosen secret word.
The user guesses the word by entering letters one at a time.
The game informs the user whether the guess was correct or not, and the progress is shown on the screen.
Once the user guesses the word correctly or runs out of attempts, the game ends with a victory or defeat message.
The user can start a new round at any time.
